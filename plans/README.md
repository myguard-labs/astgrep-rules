# Canonical rule plans

New mechanically generated rules keep their versioned source plan under
`plans/<language>/<category>/<id>.yml`. The mirrored rule and fixture remain
ordinary ast-grep YAML for downstream compatibility.

Run `npm run generate:check` to preflight plans, exact oracles, mutations, and
generated-file drift. Run `npm run generate` to update only artifacts owned by
plans. Existing handcrafted rules can be migrated independently.

Imported rules preserve required license and source comments through the
single-line `comments` list. Non-native top-level metadata belongs under
`extensions`; reserved ast-grep configuration keys cannot be overridden there.
Structurally redundant mutations retained for diagnostic-label compatibility
may be named under `mutation_exclusions`; each needs a reviewable rationale.

Plans may declare a syntax-only coverage matrix under `claims`. Its dimensions
are `api`, `callee`, `operator`, `argument-position`, `literal-form`, and
`syntax`; each named value lists invalid fixture sources that witness it. Every
value and every cross-dimension pair must share a witness, so a broad claim
cannot ride on disconnected examples. Runtime types, reachability, ownership,
and trust are deliberately outside this schema and need a semantic analyzer.

The optional `metamorphic` list classifies derived syntax explicitly. Each row
names a fixture `source`, one supported `transform`, and whether its detection
outcome is `equivalent` or `different`. Supported transforms cover
parenthesization, qualified-name variants, pointer/member-access swaps and
spacing, literal concatenation/spacing, and printf-style width or precision.
Inapplicable or contradictory transforms fail before contrast tests; each
transform is restricted to grammars where the spelling is meaningful, and
every derived source must parse without ERROR or MISSING nodes. Generated
candidates never invent their own oracle.

Mutation preflight batches all loadable candidates into one pinned-engine test
process. An engine-load failure is bisected only far enough to attribute the
invalid or erroneous candidate; ordinary killed and surviving mutants retain
their stable mutation paths. All batches share the plan's cumulative deadline.
`rule-plan.py PLAN --telemetry FILE.json` records deterministic plan, case,
exclusion, input-byte, engine-process, and mutant counts alongside explicitly
informational wall-clock phase timings.
The mutation limit counts required mutants, while documented exclusions remain
batch-validated outside that budget. Timed-out engine invocations terminate
their complete process groups. The compiler validates and renders one
recursively immutable plan representation, which is then shared by generation,
preflight, and compatibility callers.
